Our classes encompass movement, the introduction of grace and technique, and also rhythm. Dancers use all their senses as they listen to upbeat and engaging music and are led by the highly trained dance instructors. ",

It is this age group where most of our dancers really begin to get comfortable with exploring their creativity. Our classes are also designed to be able to really indulge in a variety of styles and begin to find that inner passion for dance, even at a young age! Maintain a strong mind and body as your dancer engages in jazz, hip-hop, tap, ballet, flamenco, or acro classes.",

With the increasing worry and rigor of school and growing up in general, our classes have been a creative and healthy experience for children within this age range. Styles varying between jazz, ballet, tap, hip-hop, lyrical, flamenco, and acro each offer something unique to your dancer, but all provide an introduction to a healthy lifestyle both physically and mentally. Your dancer will explore rhythm, movement, space, and technique, while feeling challenged and excited! Ascendance Studio classes for this age level have groomed long-lasting friendships and a lifelong passion in dance! ",

Surrounded by dancers of similar ages, our teen classes provide a comfortable experience where energy and creativity meet in the middle. From jazz, tap, and hip-hop to lyrical, jazz funk, and ballet, teens love taking more than one Ascendance Studio dance class in conjunction. While the styles all complement each other, our teen dancers feel self-motivated and more prepared when they take two or more classes because the concepts and technique in one generally reinforce the concepts and technique in the other(s). Dancers learn responsibility with time management, as well as beneficial ways to exercise physical, mental, and emotional health. Focus on rigid technique and flow in ballet class, let out your inner groove in hip-hop class, or choose from our other amazing class offeringsâ€“ the sky is the limit.",
