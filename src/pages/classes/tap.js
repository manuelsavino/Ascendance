          How does Ascendance manage Tap classes
        </SubHeading>
        <Paragraph>
          The direct answer to this question is: in the most fun and
          entertaining way possible. Tap is a fundamental style in our dance
          studio. Our tap program grows every year as more dancers develop a
          passion for the style. Our tap instructors are not afraid to go above
          and beyond to help your child connect to the class and develop a
          passion of their own for the style.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          For our younger artists, we offer the chance to take a dip into the
          vast ocean of rhythm and indulge in the basics of tap dance. From the
          very early age of three years old, our dancers are trained in
          ballet/tap fusion classes where 30 minutes of the class are dedicated
          to ballet technique and the other 30 to musicality and rhythm. Our
          instructors provide students with various musical props to help the
          dancer not only connect the rhythm to their feet but make the
          connection in their minds as well. Our across-the-floor exercises are
          made to increase coordination within the body so that our students can
          apply their rhythms and timing to movement and transitions,
          encompassing the “big picture” and not just their feet! One element
          that makes our tap program at{" "}
          <CopyLink to="/"> Ascendance Studio</CopyLink> unique is the
          creativity that our instructors use to keep tap evolving in the modern
          world. Dancers tap to modern well known music that keeps them
          motivated and gives them a familiar element. The variety of genres our
          classes listen and dance to enables them to build a strong sense of
          rhythm and find the beat in any song!
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          In addition, our junior and teen dancers are challenged to try
          different styles within tap. Terminology is emphasized early on in our
          curriculum. Within the first few weeks, dancers surprise themselves
          with their abundant knowledge of the style and are even more proud of
          their progress. Tap is a very intricate style that requires a lot of
          attention and focus. Accomplishing a set of exercises or even a single
          step brings a joy that one cannot even begin to imagine. It’s the
          easiest dance form, but that proud smile makes it all worth it!{" "}

        <Paragraph>
          To begin, tap teaches students rhythm and musicality. Your child will
          have the ability to create music with their feet, feel confident in
          identifying different beats in the music and learn to create and
          follow rhythms and patterns. As the style of dance which is the most
          percussive, tap dancers learn how to be the music and how to identify
          and apply a variety of time signatures, comparable to music theory.
          Gaining this skill will benefit them in every other style of dance
          that they pursue, opening the doors to an all-encompassing experience
          using mind, body, and ears! Counting music is essential to all dance
          forms– encourage your child to start early! With strong foundations in
          musicality and logical awareness, tap dance can be a complex style but
          keeps the mind engaged and thinking. Tap dancers develop their focus
          skills during every class, as they learn new patterns/combinations and
          build on to previous ones. Creating rhythms takes more than just a
          simple stroke of the ground– it requires the ability to count music
          while undergoing physical activity, simultaneously. In turn, tap
          dancers have strong coordination skills and are able to think in
          unconventional and creative ways, as they identify and dance to
          different layers in any piece of music. Also, being exposed to a tap
          class not only helps dancers develop long-lasting friendships, it
          presents them with unique challenges that they perhaps would not
          experience in a different activity. We encourage you to register your
          child in a tap class so that they can feel the joy and sense of pride
          that we experience when they successfully grasp complex concepts and
          rise to the challenge!

        <SubHeading>Origins of Tap Dance</SubHeading>
        <Paragraph>
          Tap is a percussive style that stems from various cultural
          backgrounds. Irish, Scottish and English clog dancing, along with
          African rhythms and influence are all found at the root of tap dance.
          Historians claim that these European and African groups developed the
          style by living side by side in the urban, machine age in New York
          City. It was in The Big Apple that the style truly evolved into what
          it is today. At <CopyLink to="/"> Ascendance Studio</CopyLink>, your
          child will learn to create rhythm through syncopated patterns and
          percussive beats. Our program is designed to preserve the history of
          tap while promoting its continuous evolution. Combining strong
          technique for a solid foundation and a rhythm tap style, it is our
          versatile instruction that makes our program unique. From Broadway
          style classic tap to the “hoofer” style of tap dance, your child will
          gain exposure to it all!
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          It was not until the 1920’s that the style of tap dance that is more
          well-known today, emerged in the United States. It was during this
          time that dancers began training in all styles in order to become
          versatile and employable by big Broadway shows and major productions.
          If a dancer had an audition, chances are, they needed to know how to
          tap dance!
