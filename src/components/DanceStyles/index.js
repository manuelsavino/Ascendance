From jazz, tap, and hip-hop to lyrical, jazz funk, and ballet, teens love taking more than one Ascendance Studio dance class in conjunction. While the styles all complement each other, our teen dancers feel self-motivated and more prepared when they take two or more classes because the concepts and technique in one generally reinforce the concepts and technique in the other(s). Dancers learn responsibility with time management, as well as beneficial ways to exercise physical, mental, and emotional health. Focus on rigid technique and flow in ballet class, let out your inner groove in hip-hop class, or choose from our other amazing class offeringsâ€“ the sky is the limit.",

The music associated with this genre of dance tends to be softer and more soothing than the music for other styles of dance. Dancers aim to correlate their movements to the changing rhythms of the music by utilizing the control and technical skills that they have learned in class. Lyrical teaches patience and determination when aiming to master new skills, especially those that require multiple weeks or even months to perfect.  ",

The dancers try to express their deepest emotions by using body movements and facial expressions. Today, flamenco dance is becoming more popular worldwide, not only because of its beauty, but because this form of dance teaches how to isolate movement and strengthen the muscles.
